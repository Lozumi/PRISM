- **Metric design:** Designed evaluation metrics at both instruction and sentence levels for fine-grained UAV VLN
- **Publications:** Co-authored three papers: accepted by ICAUS 2025 (EI), submitted to CVPR 2026 and Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica (EI)

### Team Member, Academic Project: Fine-grained Action Recognition under Temporal Corruption

*Dec 2024 – Aug 2025*  
Supervisor: Prof. Dian Shao (NPU)

**Overview:** Addressing Fine-grained Action Recognition under Temporal Corruption in skeleton sequences, proposed FineTec, a unified framework integrating context-aware sequence completion, skeleton-based spatial decomposition and physics-driven acceleration modeling. Constructed the Gym288-skeleton dataset with 38K fine-grained annotations. Achieved 89.1% and 78.1% Top-1 accuracy on Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe.

**Contributions:**
- **Fine-grained dataset construction:** Completed annotations for 12K segments of competitive sports videos based on Gym99, forming the Gym288-skeleton dataset
- **Algorithm design:** Co-designed the fine-grained action recognition architecture; implemented the skeleton sequence completion module using in-context learning and multi-mask strategies
- **Publication:** Co-authored paper accepted by AAAI 2026

### Team Leader, College Students' Innovative Training Program

*Jun 2024 – Dec 2024*  
**Project:** Public Transport Anomaly Diagnosis and Optimisation System based on Spatio-temporal Causality

**Overview:** Aggregated multi-source transport and urban data; built a governance pipeline including causal representation, anomaly detection, root-cause tracing, and assistant Q&A, leveraging ST-GNN.

**Contributions:**
- Designed seven categories of metrics across multi-source data
- Developed web system using Vue.js Framework
- **Achievement:** Won "Challenge Cup" 2024 "Revealing-the-List" Special Track — Second Prize
