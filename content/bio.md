I am an undergraduate student in the School of Software, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), expected to graduate in June 2026. I am currently working under the guidance of [Prof. Dian Shao](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/shaodian.html) at the Unmanned Systems Research Institute, NPU.

My research focuses on intelligent video understanding, UAV Vision-and-Language Navigation, and UAV 3D spatial understanding. I am passionate about applying AI algorithms to unmanned vehicles and exploring cognitive intelligence in embodied AI systems.

I have published papers at conferences including ICAUS 2025, AAAI 2026, and have patents and translated work in fields like computer vision and robotics.

I'm currently seeking Ph.D./MPhil opportunities, if you’re interested in my work or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to email me—I look forward to connecting and will respond promptly!
